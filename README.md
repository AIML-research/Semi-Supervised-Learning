# Semi-Supervised-Learning

In this repository, we have implemented semi-supervised methods for text classification which can be deployed in SPARK distributed system.


Under the TwitterPreprocessing, we have implemented the text preprocessing part of our process.

Self-Learning, Co-Training classification have been implemented for textual classification.
